        <p class="lead">I'm a guy who is 21 year at age. I live in Mitchell's Plain where i attended Meadowridge Primary School and went to Spine Road High School during my young days. I went to Cape Peninsula University of Technology for 3 years but never got to finished it. Now im following a dream that i had as a kid, to have influence over the game world I want to make.</p>
        <p class="lead">I'm the type of person who's motivated and driven to be a great person someday. I'm not afraid to take a risk to learn new stuff. I always like to interact with people that would help me become a better version of myself. I love reading books, learning new technology, doing exercises and playing games. Also, I really do enjoy spend time with myself. To clear unwanted thought that might affect me.</p>
